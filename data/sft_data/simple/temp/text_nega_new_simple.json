Analyze the textual demonstration to understand how the task progresses from start to completion.\n3. Identify the reference step from the textual demonstration that are most related to the current state image.\n4. Compare the current state image with the chosen reference step, determining whether the image is behind or after the reference step.\n5.

The demonstration consists of a sequence of text-based steps and their corresponding progress value (ranging from 0% to 100%), showing how the task evolves from start to completion.\n\n\nOur goal is place the bowl with banana on the tray.\n\n\nHere is the demonstration:\nStep 1. [left] move towards the banana\nThe Progress for now is 10%.\n\nStep 2. [left] grab the banana\nThe Progress for now is 20%.\n\nStep 3. [left] move the banana towards the bowl\nThe Progress for now is 30%.\n\nStep 4. [left] put the banana into the bowl\nThe Progress for now is 40%.\n\nStep 5. [left] move away from the banana\nThe Progress for now is 50%.\n\nStep 6. [right] move towards the bowl\nThe Progress for now is 60%.\n\nStep 7. [right] grab the bowl\nThe Progress for now is 70%.\n\nStep 8. [right] move the bowl towards the tray\nThe Progress for now is 80%.\n\nStep 9. [right] put the bowl on the tray\nThe Progress for now is 90%.\n\nStep 10. [right] move away from the bowl\nThe Progress for now is 100%.\n\n\nHere is the current state that you need to estimate:\n<image>\n\n\nYour Task:\n1. Check the current state image carefully.\n2. Analyze the textual demonstration to understand how the task progresses from start to completion.\n3. Identify the reference step from the textual demonstration that are most related to the current state image.\n4. Compare the current state image with the chosen reference step, determining whether the image is behind or after the reference step.\n5. Estimate the progress numerically as a floating-point value between 0% and 100%, or directly output n/a if you really cannot match the current state image to any of the steps from demonstration.\n\nYour answer only needs to output the final progress score you estimated, no other words needed."

Check the current state image carefully.\n2. Analyze the textual demonstration to understand how the task progresses from start to completion.\n3. Identify the reference step from the textual demonstration that are most related to the current state image.\n4. Compare the current state image with the chosen reference step, determining whether the image is behind or after the reference step.\n5.

Analyze the textual demonstration to understand how the task progresses from start to completion.\n3. Identify the reference step from the textual demonstration that are most related to the current state image.\n4.

Identify the reference step from the textual demonstration that are most related to the current state image.\n4. Compare the current state image with the chosen reference step, determining whether the image is behind or after the reference step.\n5. Estimate the progress numerically as a floating-point value between 0% and 100%, or directly output n/a if you really cannot match the current state image to any of the steps from demonstration.\n\nYour answer only needs to output the final progress score you estimated, no other words needed."
